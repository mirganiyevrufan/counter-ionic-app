# counter-ionic-app
Counter React Ionic app
This Ionic application shows important changes made to the Ionic's root CSS in addition to serving as a counter. The second page includes information about game called 'LOL'. Moreover, the application is responsive and functions both on mobile and desktop.
I also deployed it with the firebase hosting. The link to the app: https://ionic-app-new.web.app/
